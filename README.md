# EduDataMining

This project is to analyze the homework data collected from UCSD and study the effectiveness of our intelligent hint system.

Hints are sent automatically to a student when we think the student is struggling on homework problems. We want to see whether our hints help students do their homework and also help students learn the class material.

### Repo Structure
* ```data``` contains anonymous data collected from CSE103 at UCSD. Data files are formated using Python Pandas Dataframe and saved as pickle files. We also have some data formated specifically for LIBSVM.
* ```ipynb``` contains some ipython notebook that we used to do data analysis.
* ```graphs``` contains statistical graphs rendered from our data analysis.
